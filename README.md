# FlexiLogger

**FlexiLogger** is a lightweight and easy-to-integrate logging library for Android. It allows you to log messages with custom tags and log levels directly to a persistent local file (`flexi_logs.txt`). This can be extremely helpful for debugging apps outside of the development environment â€” especially when user-side issues are difficult to reproduce.
